# What is Death?

在Bostrom的人看来，死亡就是恶龙。人们麻木于恶龙，而不寄希望于打倒他。对于Bostrom来说，死亡是外部的，是邪恶的。这里涉及的核心问题就是：死亡是否是我们的一部分？接受死亡的话语是人类自我安慰的麻痹剂，还是一种真正的自我和解？transhumanist 会说，一个人的死亡就是图书馆的消失，所以我们应该消灭死亡。但作者认为这样的话反过来说就不成立：这不就意味着没有对世界的知识作出贡献的人，例如智力并非超群这，甚至是有智力障的人，就死不足惜了？越是想要用功利主义证明死亡是邪恶的，越是落入功利主义的陷阱。

死亡并非我们身外之物，死亡一直存在的。我们身上总有无数的细胞死亡，只是我们以为我们活着。实际上每天的自己都死去了，新的自己又诞生了。人的意义不应只在于它能从知识生产或者劳动生产上贡献什么。一个人活着本身就是一种意义。把活着的意义和知识等同起来是危险而有偏颇的

“The hero of Bostrom’s story is the one who finally hatches a plan to slay the dragon, which represents death, and succeeds. Bostrom advocates in the parable for the moral necessity of developing anti-aging technology” (Hall, 2017, p. 1) 

“For Bostrom, death is not something fundamental to life or embodiment, but rather a threat which is utterly excessive and unjust.” (Hall, 2017, p. 2) 

“From these perspectives, it appears that death is not a fixed part of life—life and death are detachable, and death is a foreign threat to life. Further, it seems, we can measure the value of human life by way of knowledge—individual human beings are valuable because they contribute knowledge to a global library.” (Hall, 2017, p. 2) 

“Yet, death seems immanent to life—cell death occurs regularly in our bodies, and indeed we die even as we live” (Hall, 2017, p. 2) 

“the view that knowledge production is the reason human lives are valuable, or even the primary reason human lives are valuable, is at best a partial and misleading picture and, at worst, dangerous and deadly for those excluded. If one concedes that knowledge is what makes life valuable, this implies that persons whose knowledge is discounted or disqualified—people with intellectual disabilities, along with other vulnerable people around the globe—do not have lives worth living. Contesting this caricature of human life is part of the project of this book” (Hall, 2017, p. 2) 

“One cannot assume that enhancement is morally acceptable without, in effect, refusing to enter the debate before it begins” (Hall, 2017, p. 3)

“how can enhancement be morally evaluated?” (Hall, 2017, p. 3)

“Some philosophers use these two distinctions, between the authentic and the unauthentic and between therapy and enhancement, to maintain that only authentic or therapeutic enhancements are morally acceptable, thereby taking much of what proponents of enhancement mean when they use the word “enhancement” off the table. Others, like Harris, forego these distinctions to argue that all enhancements—globally—are not only morally acceptable but also morally obligatory” (Hall, 2017, p. 3) 如果只有是否authentic，是否是therapeutic来衡量是站不住脚的，

“The moral motive for using technology to intervene in the natural lottery of life is for the sake of the goods that this will bring about . . . equality of opportunity may sometimes be one of these goods . . . saving lives or what is the same thing, postponing death, removing or preventing disability or disease or enhancing human functioning are the more obvious and usually the more pressing reasons. (2011, 147) This passage conflates “removing or preventing disability or disease” and “enhancing human functioning.” In practice, the distinction between positive and negative eugenics is just as misleading as other common divides. The commonplace view that disability is to be avoided, and to enhance means much the same thing as avoiding disability, means that a disability analysis of enhancement issues is necessary” (Hall, 2017, p. 4) 把提高和优生等同，等于把disability直接等同于需要被消灭的东西

“If we focus on enhancement’s goals, rather than slippery distinctions, we can critically assess enhancement and avoid begging the moral question of enhancement (i.e. assuming that enhancement is good, full stop). The burden in the debate is thus shifted back to proponents of enhancement, who—as we shall discover—weave fantasies of health, ability, and the good life that are troublesome and exclusionary” (Hall, 2017, p. 4) 我们也需要从动机上去观察这种叙事——到底是谁在铸造关于健康、能力和更好的生活的神话

“it is worth noting that some more moderate philosophers play it too safe with regard to enhancement. They make proposals with which no one would disagree, such as being sure any proposed enhancement is accessible and effective and that harm to individuals is to be avoided at all costs. These qualifications do not get us any clearer on the special issues presented by the ethical question of enhancement—indeed, they sound like prescriptions for action for any public policy development, and they are subject to the same roadblocks” (Hall, 2017, p. 5) 只是说这些设施是免费的，fully accessible的，并不会变成一个免死金牌。它只是逃避了关于enhancement很本质的问题，而且是一个过于理想化的想象。

“Bioethicists discuss everything from the body-contouring effects of liposuction to scientific research aimed at discovering ways to counteract the aging process in cells. But, emerging technologies, including genetic screening and editing procedures such as CRISPR, capture center stage.2 Nootropic drugs (cognitive enhancers like modafinil), also receive high levels of attention (Battleday and Brem 2015). So, what is uniquely at stake in contemporary discussions is the acceptability of heritable medical interventions, with special attention to the mind” (Hall, 2017, p. 5) 现代医学的很多技术都是用来对抗细胞和身体的老化和dysfunction的，但是最核心的辩论是在那些可以被遗传的改造上，例如CRISPR技术。

“those who are pro-enhancement. This group is typically referred to as “bio-libertarian” and overlaps significantly with thinkers who consider themselves transhumanists, or at least fellow travelers. Bio-conservatives and bio-libertarians are treated, by those both inside and outside of the debate, as if they were in deep disagreement” (Hall, 2017, p. 5)

“Ramsey worried that we sought to produce a man-God hybrid by genetic means who would destroy “the sanctity of the individual” (146).” (Hall, 2017, p. 6) 保守派的重要思想来源于一些神学的部分——我们是否会造出一个新的神出来

“thinkers like Jürgen Habermas and Michael Sandel enjoin us to protect the boundaries of human nature, along with human dignity, from interference and temptation. Tied to this are Sandel’s appeals, which echo Kass’s work, to human wisdom and appropriate humility. Resonating among bio-conservatives is a commonplace claim originally made by Ramsey: “Men ought not to play God before they learn to be men, and after they have learned to be men they will not play God” (1970, 137” (Hall, 2017, p. 6)

“The “playing God” objection is curious because it assumes that technology can give us such total control that we might as well call ourselves God. This is chimerical. But, more curious still is the fact that transhumanists also embrace a portrait of technology that implies God-like control, a move which mystifies and elevates technology (Bostrom 2003)” (Hall, 2017, p. 6) 保守派和激进派都同意这种“科技造神”的想象

“Outsized belief in the power of technology over human life, as if it were a foreign invader, is shared by proponents and opponents of enhancement technologies alike” (Hall, 2017, p. 6)

“Beyond the mystification and elevation of technology to a God-like role, otherwise-opposed bioethicists agree on the importance of authenticity, the uniqueness of human beings, and the importance of equal opportunity. This overlap is significant.3” (Hall, 2017, p. 6) 实际上保守派和激进派都会强调平等和人类的独特性，但是他们一个是靠拒绝改造实现，一个是靠人人都改造来实现。

“First, authenticity;” (Hall, 2017, p. 6)

“Thinking back to Bostrom’s parable, consider that he poses death as an obstacle to loving human relationships. Death is an interruption which dissolves communities—so enhancement strategies which subvert death can enhance human communities and our authentic selves in turn” (Hall, 2017, p. 7)

“Second, both sides of the debate claim that the human being is uniquely placed among the things in the natural world.” (Hall, 2017, p. 7)

“Yet Bostrom and transhumanist Anders Sandberg argue that paying attention to human wisdom (as the bio-conservative desires) requires taking enhancement seriously because humans are uniquely situated to draw lessons from history and evolution (Bostrom 2004; Bostrom and Sandberg 2011).” (Hall, 2017, p. 7)

“Another touchstone in this debate is equality of opportunity, which is called upon to both justify and object to interventionist medical and technological enhancement strategies.” (Hall, 2017, p. 7)

“They claim that the arena of justice is, in effect, a phenomenon of slow “colonization” of circumstances once left to chance (82–84). On this view, intervention is only ethically justified when we have control over (have colonized) circumstances, but that realm grows along with new technologies and scientific understanding. This is a technological imperative. That is, as technology becomes available that can be used to intervene upon the human body, one should use it. Buchanan et al. justify this imperative via the concept of equal opportunity” (Hall, 2017, p. 7)

“Peter Singer invokes equal opportunity to discuss possible negative effects of enhancement, specifically genetic interventions. He claims that genetic intervention would work against equal opportunity unless it is regulated (2011). This is because of its potential, in a global marketplace, to be used only by already-advantaged persons with ready access to wealth” (Hall, 2017, p. 8) 一开始有钱的人自然是更容易获得这些access，就像万神殿里最开始能获得上传的都是富家子弟。

“some have argued that cloning is an affront to human dignity, because it inhibits a kind of right to be an individual. But, arguments of this kind elevate the importance of replicated DNA material to the level of identity.” (Hall, 2017, p. 8) DNA不等同于一个人的identity，但这个事情在Caspian 和Stephen的关系中就很有意思。Caspian虽然是Stephen的克隆，但是他的人生却和Stephen大相径庭。

“argue that cloning is a technological innovation of key importance for future change engages the body as a site of political problemsolving” (Hall, 2017, p. 8) 把所有问题的希望寄托在克隆身上，似乎也是把身体看作一个可以轻松解决政治问题解决的场域。

“advocates of the use of cloning technology strictly separate reproduction via cloning from typical reproduction, which also signals a kind of misunderstanding—reproduction, as Derrida contends, is always a matter of repetition, and cloning will always involve novel elements (146–148).” (Hall, 2017, p. 8) 生育包含复制，而克隆也往往包含新生。

(Hall, 2017, p. 9) 在克隆的讨论中基因决定论是兵家必争之地，也是很多对于克隆的反对者会提出的质疑。主要的分论点是以下几点：\
1\. 基因改造会限制人类的自由\
2\. 孩子不再是礼物而是产品\
3\. 才能和天赋不再是他本人应得的\
4\. 克隆人的独特性是被侵犯的\
\
然而上面的每一条都是对基因作用的夸大。

“This is because making public policy recommendations that would dedicate a vast sum of funds to create genetic enhancement technologies and make them available to the public at least approaches what Mianna Lotz refers to as “geneticism”—the privileging of genetic causes over other factors—if not a stronger variety of genetic determinism” (Hall, 2017, p. 9) 向政府提议把经费花在基因技术上，不管是多mild的建议，也是一种对基因决定论的支持。毕竟有这钱，为啥不花在基础建设上面？
